# Stopwatch Component

A React-based stopwatch component that provides accurate timekeeping with start, stop, and reset functionalities. This is a lightweight and reusable component for time-related applications or personal projects.

## Features

- **Start**: Begin tracking time with millisecond precision.
- **Stop**: Pause the timer while retaining the elapsed time.
- **Reset**: Reset the timer back to 00:00:00:00.

## Preview

The Stopwatch component displays the elapsed time in the following format:

`HH:MM:SS:MS`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Import the component into your React application:
   ```javascript
   import Stopwatch from './Stopwatch';
   ```
2. Add it to your application:
   ```jsx
   function App() {
       return (
           <div className="App">
               <Stopwatch />
           </div>
       );
   }
   export default App;
   ```

## How It Works

- **State Management**: The component uses `useState` to manage running state and elapsed time.
- **Ref for Timing**: `useRef` is used to store references to the start time and the interval ID for efficient interval handling.
- **Effect Hook**: `useEffect` ensures that the interval runs only when the stopwatch is running, cleaning up when stopped or unmounted.

## Development

- Clone the repository as mentioned above.
- Run the application locally:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

## Styling

The Stopwatch component uses basic CSS for styling. You can customize it further by modifying or adding styles to match your application's theme.
